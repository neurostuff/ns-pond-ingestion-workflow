        prefrontal\u2010limbic network in the human brain plays a major role in social
        cognition, especially cognitive control of emotion. The medial frontopolar
        cortex (mFP; Brodmann Area 10) and the amygdala are part of this network and
        display correlated neuronal activity in time, as measured by functional magnetic
        resonance imaging (fMRI). This functional connectivity is dynamic, sensitive
        to training, and affected in mental disorders. However, the effects of neurostimulation
        on functional connectivity within this network have not yet been systematically
        investigated. Here, we investigate the effects of both low\u2010 and high\u2010frequency
        repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the right mFP on functional
        connectivity between mFP and amygdala, as measured with resting state fMRI
        (rsfMRI). Three groups of healthy participants received either low\u2010frequency
        rTMS (1 Hz; N = 18), sham TMS (1 Hz, subthreshold; N = 18) or high\u2010frequency
        rTMS (20\u2009Hz; N = 19). rsfMRI was acquired before and after (separate
        days). We hypothesized a modulation of functional connectivity in opposite
        directions compared to sham TMS through adjustment of the stimulation frequency.
        Groups differed in functional connectivity between mFP and amygdala after
        stimulation compared to before stimulation (low\u2010frequency: decrease,
        high\u2010frequency: increase). Motion or induced changes in neuronal activity
        were excluded as confounders. Results show that rTMS is effective for increasing
        and decreasing functional coherence between prefrontal and limbic regions.
        This finding is relevant for social and affective neuroscience as well as
        novel treatment approaches in psychiatry."}]
