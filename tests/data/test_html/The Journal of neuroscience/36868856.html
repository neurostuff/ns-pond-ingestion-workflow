<meta name="DC.Description" content="Monitoring sequential information is an essential component of our daily lives. Many of these sequences are abstract, in that they do not depend on the individual stimuli, but do depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking). Despite the ubiquity and utility of abstract sequential monitoring, little is known about its neural mechanisms. Human rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits specific increases in neural activity (i.e., “ramping”) during abstract sequences. Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to represent sequential information in motor (not abstract) sequence tasks, and contains a sub-region, area 46, with homologous functional connectivity to human RLPFC. To test the prediction that area 46 may represent abstract sequence information, and do so with parallel dynamics to those found in humans, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in three male monkeys. When monkeys performed no-report abstract sequence viewing, we found that left and right area 46 responded to abstract sequential changes. Interestingly, responses to rule and number changes overlapped in right area 46 and left area 46 exhibited responses to abstract sequence rules with changes in ramping activation, similar to that observed in humans. Together, these results indicate that monkey DLPFC monitors abstract visual sequential information, potentially with a preference for different dynamics in the two hemispheres. More generally, these results show that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.

Significance Statement 

Daily, we complete sequences that are “abstract” because they depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking) rather than the identity of individual items. Little is known about how the brain tracks, or monitors, this abstract sequential information. Based on previous human work showing abstract sequence related dynamics in an analogous area, we tested if monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), specifically area 46, represents abstract sequential information using awake monkey fMRI. We found that area 46 responded to abstract sequence changes, with a preference for more general responses on the right and dynamics similar to humans on the left. These results suggest that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.">

Many of these sequences are abstract, in that they do not depend on the individual stimuli, but do depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking). Despite the ubiquity and utility of abstract sequential monitoring, little is known about its neural mechanisms. Human rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits specific increases in neural activity (i.e., “ramping”) during abstract sequences. Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to represent sequential information in motor (not abstract) sequence tasks, and contains a sub-region, area 46, with homologous functional connectivity to human RLPFC. To test the prediction that area 46 may represent abstract sequence information, and do so with parallel dynamics to those found in humans, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in three male monkeys. When monkeys performed no-report abstract sequence viewing, we found that left and right area 46 responded to abstract sequential changes. Interestingly, responses to rule and number changes overlapped in right area 46 and left area 46 exhibited responses to abstract sequence rules with changes in ramping activation, similar to that observed in humans. Together, these results indicate that monkey DLPFC monitors abstract visual sequential information, potentially with a preference for different dynamics in the two hemispheres. More generally, these results show that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.</p><p id="p-4"><strong>Significance Statement</strong></p><p id="p-5">Daily, we complete sequences that are “abstract” because they depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking) rather than the identity of individual items. Little is known about how the brain tracks, or monitors, this abstract sequential information. Based on previous human work showing abstract sequence related dynamics in an analogous area, we tested if monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), specifically area 46, represents abstract sequential information using awake monkey fMRI. We found that area 46 responded to abstract sequence changes, with a preference for more general responses on the right and dynamics similar to humans on the left. These results suggest that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.</p></div><div class="section fn-group" id="fn-group-1"><h2>Footnotes</h2><ul><li class="fn-conflict" id="fn-2"><p id="p-6">The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p></li><li class="fn-supported-by" id="fn-3"><p id="p-7">We thank Matthew Maestri for his assistance with animal training and data collection.
